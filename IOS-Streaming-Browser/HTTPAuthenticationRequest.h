    @brief Gets the uri
    Indicates the principal name of the service with which the client wishes to connect, formed from the serv-type, host, and serv-name.

    Servers SHOULD check that the supplied value is correct. This will detect accidental connection to the incorrect server. It is also so that clients will be trained to provide values that will work with implementations that use a shared back-end authentication service that can provide server authentication.
 
    The serv-type component should match the service being offered. The host component should match one of the host names of the host on which the service is running, or it's IP address. Servers SHOULD NOT normally support the IP address form, because server authentication by IP address is not very useful; they should only do so if the DNS is unavailable or unreliable. The serv-name component should match one of the service's configured service names.
 
    This directive may appear at most once; if multiple instances are present, the client should abort the authentication exchange.
